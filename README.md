# Function-Generator-
Created a frequency and output gain controlled function generator that outputs both triangular and square waves
Designed and built a fully analog Voltage-Controlled Function Generator (VCFG) capable of producing square and triangular waveforms with the following specifications:
Waveform Types: Symmetrical square and triangular waves.
Control Voltage Range: 0.1 V to 5 V.
Frequency Output:
Range 1: 100 Hz to fx (≈4400 Hz for this project).
Range 2: 20 Hz to fx/5.
Linear Transfer Function: fo=K . Vc
Amplitude Control: 0–8 V peak-to-peak for both waveforms.
Power Supply: ±12 V only.
Design Constraints: OP-AMPs and discrete components only; no IC waveform generators.
